Please check task distribution word documents, thank you.

What is really amazing is the you can sign in and the user information is stored in json object!
Please don't refresh the page, then it will store all the information including user, food, and the food that you have picked as my recipe!

MyRecipe page shows every different recipe that had been chosen by the specific user. 

I made json object like database concept, and made it work like back-end with only js and react.
I helped my team mates to make our project better and for the bootstrap, I got help from my team mates.

I am really interested in managing data, controlling data in Collections or JSON and validating them, sorting them.
I tried to use my algorithms skills when the user tried to search their food in the search engine, I tried to use Binary Search 
to make the time complexity even faster as Log(N) instead of using for Loop. 

I also tried to organize them in folders which have commons. (such as inputComponents, pageComponents, foodComponents, ButtonComponents)
I tried to reuse Components instead of making new one everytime!
